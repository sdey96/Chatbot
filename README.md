# Chatbot Project

This repository contains a chatbot project built using Python, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to respond to user queries based on predefined text data and can handle multiple `.txt` files to extract relevant information.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes NLP for tokenization, lemmatization, and keyword-based response generation.
- **Multi-file Support**: Reads and processes multiple `.txt` files simultaneously to broaden the scope of information available for responses.
- **Interactive Responses**: Includes greeting responses, can answer questions about the date, and follows up with users based on their responses.
- **Context Awareness**: Tracks the context of conversations to provide relevant follow-up questions and maintain a conversational flow.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

3. **Install the required Python packages:**


## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data**: Place your `.txt` files in the project directory. The chatbot will read and process these files to respond to user queries.
2. **Run the Chatbot**: Execute the chatbot script.
3. **Interact**: Engage with the chatbot through the terminal. The bot can respond to greetings, provide information based on the loaded `.txt` files, tell the current date, and more.
